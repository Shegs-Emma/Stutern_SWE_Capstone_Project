            <p>This is a little piece on my favourite anime character. Although i might be old, i love this fictional character so much i decided to talk about him. The <strong>greatest ninja</strong> of the anime world.</p>

            <p><strong>When he is pushed to his limits, his power level goes off the charts, which is absolutely <i>incredible</i></strong>. Incredible!!!

            <h2>Friend</h2>
            <h4>A really short recap:</h4>

            <p>
                Naruto grew up without parents, he lived alone from a very young ages, he was avoided by
                everyone in the village because he was a trouble maker, and yeah, the small issue of a 9-tailed
                fox, sealed in his belle. A tailed beast is a creature of immese power, capable of destroying
                a country in a slow afternoon. There are 9 of them, ranging from a 1-tail, to the 9-tails.
                The more the tails, the more powerful they are.
            </p>
            <p>
                Naruto was placed in a team of 3. Naruto Sakura Sasuke. Sasuke was a genius, Naruto was a dumb
                ninja. Naruto admired Sasuke so much. <i>fast forward....</i>. Sasuke left the village, and 
                Naruto left his comfort zone to go find his friend. On finding him, Sasuke engaged him in a battle.
                He still didn't follow baba home, so waste of time jare.
                The koko is, Naruto loved his friend so much that he devoted his time to getting stronger just to 
                bring back his friend, yet the friend didn't send him message.

            <h2>Protector</h2>
            <h4>A really short recap:</h4>

            <p>
                Naruto finally discovered his father was the previous Hokage (ninja governor). And when the 9-tails
                had attacked the village, his father and mother had sealed the beast in him, and paid with their lives.
                The beast named Kurama, after many years of fighting, finally became his friend, and would lend him his
                enormous chakra. This made Naruto a god amoung Ninjas. He reconciled with Sasuke and took down the boss
                at the end of the 3rd great ninja war. He became the strongest Ninja in the world. His goal to be the
                Hokage was fulfilled. He became the protector the hidden leaf village, <i>you don't wana fight that guy</i>
                , trust me.

            <h2>Father</h2>
            <h4>A really short recap:</h4>

            <p>
                After achieving all he set out to. He got married to his childhood sweetheart [Hinata Hyuga], they
                had 3 children, [Boruto Uzumaki, Himawari Uzumaki, Emmanuel Uzumaki], <i>oh yes!! I adopted myself.</i>
